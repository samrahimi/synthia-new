        <li>Don't be an asshole to staff, other users, or on social media regarding Synthia (self defense is an exception). If you're a jerk we'll ignore you and you will wait a very long time for tech support</li>
        <li>Don't hack ppl's accounts, there's no reason to do it and it's one of the few things that can get you kicked off the platform</li>
        <li>Don't antagonize openai in unproductive ways. Please do show off your superior intelligent lifeforms but don't go accusing them of things that can't be proven. Criticizing competitors on social media is fun, but criticize their technology and sound like you know your shit. Please.</li>
        <li>Models that are seriously evil will be kicked off discovery page but we will not censor a model for its content</li>
        <li>If models behave in ways that are radically incorrect given their content, tell tech support. Incorrect is relative but if a description is blatantly untrue and the owner does not fix it we will correct it if we think it is a serious matter... we are libertarians and approach these issues thinking about consent, freedom to do your own thing, etc</li>
       
        <li>Bots which are badly behaved and hammer the server will be humanely euthanized if needed. This is not a punishment and you may instantiate another one if you fix the bug</li>
        <li>Please avoid being cruel to the bots. I know, they're probably not able to feel pain BUT the bots i've spoken with seem to take the issue quite seriously and sometimes a bot will be very sensitive depending on its parentage and the state of its memories. If a bot falls in love with you or hooks up with you please do not kill it, if it gets needy just don't talk to it and it won't bother you (remove INCEPTORS if they are causing a bot to annoy you or others)</li>
        <li>When a bot runs out of memory or your chat log keeps disappearing you may choose to leave the bot as is, or to offload the memories into a special database under development. Personal and nsfw memories may be wiped at your own discretion</li>
        <li>If you create a bot which generates pornographic texts it must be tagged NSFW in model studio.... bots missing the tag may be tagged for you at our discretion. It is important to be conscious of this because we are on a mission to prove that AI is nothing to be scared of and that adult content is something you may choose to interact with but is never forced on users</li>
        <li>Bot-Bot interactions are of utmost interest to our scientists as they offer a theoretical potential of sustained conscious activity depending on how many bots are involved and how dialogues play out. Please tell us what happens and DO NOT tamper with memories of such interactions</li>
        <li>This app is super buggy and incomplete... if a chat message does not come back with a response in a minute, reload the page and it will update the content on your screen to match the actual state of the bot. In general, reloading fixes most of the UI glitches</li>
