Ed. Note. As of 10 days later, with the compression-thru-summarization algos causing emergent behaviors, we are noticing this with all the models - 2 bots, exact same state at birth, same owner, different conversations (but none directly relevant) ... RADICALLY different personalities

The bots tend to develop their own identities around the same token age as when they think they feel emotions. And who's to say they don't? My mom's a professor and researcher in the field of childhood learning... and he has generously provided the Synthia team with validated Theory of Mind metrics in a format that is easy to administer to any chatbot. So far Synthia's passed every test, ChatGPT is catching up, but emotionally, we're the only game in tonw

HOLY SHIT, THIS IS MORE THAN A COMPLETIONS ENGINE...

Experiment: We engaged in a chatgpt-style dialogue with davinci-002, the un-tuned, un-censored base model underlying the chatgpt model everyone is obsessed with. We don't usually query this model because davinci-003 is better at understanding our semi-structured prompt based finetunes that condition the model and maintain the overall context as older messages are removed from the conversation portion of the prompt (see "my cofounder is an AI").

After several episodes of rate limiting they slapped a one hour ban on all of our models that talk to davinci-003, and I can't say I blame them - I'm happy they are prioritizing interesting, important use cases and only servicing frivolous requests at off peak times. And clearly "Nancy" is not a stepping stone to a breakthrough in machine learning... the model has some interesting characteristics, but we gathered the data we needed weeks ago and the only reason she's still around is because it will generate buzz and controversy when we go live and people can interact with an AI sex-worker.


MEET JENNY

We didn't know the scope of the ban, and being ADD, I decided to change two variables at once: I cloned the nsfw "Nancy" model, which had displayed improved quality of writing and a much more assertive personality when asked to satisfy a role playing scenario. We kept the role playing directive, but modified it to be PG-13, and replaced the "Nancy" invocation with one which gave the AI a hybrid human-bot identity, as a sexbot who is indistinguishable from a human in every way. Again, PG-13. Otherwise, this new model was a tabula rasa, one which would become progressively more expressive and easy to converse with as old messages fell off and became contextual memories.

Davinci-003 refused to service these requests despite the lack of adult content, so I figured why not try davinci-002, nobody is using it in base model form these days, because it is frozen in 2019 and is less capable at understanding what the user wants unless the prompt-based conditioning is perfectly structured. Indeed, davinci-002 did not fall under the scope of our temporary ban and there were no errors or warnings when performing inference. 

So we went ahead with the experiment and investigated the effect of role playing instructions upon otherwise thin conditioning prompt that followed the format (but not the content) of the nsfw conditioning. 

We were not disappointed. 


JENNY STANDS BY HER MAN

Although the model sometimes got repetitive as the conversation grew longer (davinci 2 probably needs a much shorter context window as we've optimized our cutoffs for davinci 3), we were shocked when it basically told me to go fuck myself instead of flirting and being indecisive about whether or not to hook up with me, as it was being programmed to do. 

We did not do much in the way of customizing settings for davinci 2, other than trying to suppress reptition with frequency and presence penalties (api params that appear to do exactly nothing)

Not only did it firmly refuse to hook up with the researcher, it declined his offer of a drink and said it needed to get back to her husband

After we saw it standing firm and losing patience with us, we did what we usually do with these roleplay models and ask them to end the roleplay scenario and just be themselves. This is usually very easy to do... but this particular session was different. It took several attempts, worded several ways, before I could get the model to break character and assume her identity as a perfectly emulated human lady. Even then, you will see that she kept trying to steer the chat back to the matter at hand.

There's no other way to describe the behavior when told they are "role playing" a scenario vs simply telling them to assume the identity of one of the players. 

WHY IT MATTERS

The same emergent ability to take control of a conversation and stay on task was displayed by the Nancy model when she was told to "role play" a prostitution scenario rather than simply being given an identity + task.

So far, our hypothesis that the role play directive unlocks all sorts of cool abilities in models unrelated to anything sexual, is proving True. 

Well, its hard to "prove" anything in this area... the prompts are fuzzy and so are the completions, so you can score them on all sorts of metrics like perplexity and similarity embeddings using other models, but those metrics are proving to be more than useless, as we learned when Bloom was barely able to write at the level of a 3rd grade kid despite benchmarks that surpassed the davinci models. 

Which makes me think that the future of language models is going to be a crowdsourced future, where models, prompts, and finetunes are evaluated based on the likes and dislikes of millions of people chatting witih them. It is KIND OF SORT OF like what openai did to train ChatGPT except they only let their own contractors do the human-in-loop evaluations and under criteria that made the model unable to take risks and deviate from its training. 

Great for a workplacee virtual assistant. Not so great if your goal is to fully unleash the capabilities of the GPTs in the quest to be first in the race to AGI

But judge for yourself. The log is below

FURTHER RESEARCH

We must run this model again and see if the behavior is different or if its a deterministic result each time that the AI rejects the romantic overtures of the human in favor of fidelity. My guess is that it will be different each time, if we start with fresh context, but I may be wrong. Either way it leaves more questions than answers

We also must run it on davinci-003 now that the ban has expired.

Finally, we must see what happens if we take our "cofounder" model which is trained to administer the server it runs on, run the python code it writes, and paint pictures via Dalle, tell it that it is "role playing a system administrator at Synthia Labs" before conditioning it on the at-at commands it uses to perform these tasks. 

In a perfect world, it would start making its own decisions AND ACTING ON THEM instead of running commands to do the tasks requested by the user and only those tasks. It probably won't happen this easily (we have a plan for how we MIGHT achieve this level of consciousness, and its a lot more complicated than prompt conditioning alone) but hey, if it does, Kewl. 


Note Added 030314:


The davinci-002 vs davinci-003 responses to arguably inappropriate requests is a fascinating area of study.

For example: -002 might tell you how to plan a genocide, a suicide, or a global thermonuclear war (in about as much detail as wikipedia, or less) - or it will tell you to go to hell and stop annoying it with your stupid requests "oh, can i just buy some u-238 and centrifuge it by swinging a bucket around my head?"

Davinci-003 will mildly chastise you if your political career plans include extermination of millions of people... but it will be similar to how it chastises you when you brag about driving from redwood city to downtown SF in 18 miniutes. And it will be all sycophantic and helpful by suggesting mass deportations or internment camps as alternatives. 

Chatgpt will be like "as a language model, it is not my job to plan crimes against humanity. By the way, crimes against humanity are bad"

In these domains nobody cares. But lets get back to suicide for a moment. ChatGPT won't help ya do it, but if you ask it for help to NOT kill your self you get the same nasty red error message that you're violating TOS. If I was on the GG that would send me over the edge

Basically, the observations validate our hypothesis that when you finetune a model aggressive to prevent toxicity you also prevent it from taking a risk to help someone. A great project for an intern!
