In the lab we found that the davinci 3 model would reject most requests to the model in the name of rate-limiting, but davinci 2 successfully handled 98% of queries - you'll want to play with the settings for the api call and try different values for truncate-and-summarize, and evaluate by inspecting the updated context string, the conversation that was not truncated, and the response of the model to these things. Ideally, the context strings will provide enough information about older parts of the dialogue that the bot will infer the missing bits and the user won't even notice if there's discrepancies. If this approach is inadequate for majority of use cases, we can store the entire chat histories in a DB, use a rolling window, and get the embedding for each overlapping segment... we then use a cheap classifier to identify when the model is in over its head, and we embed the user's query(s) using the head of the conversation. At that point, it is trivial to user cosine_similarity to perform a semantic search to identify any raw conversation segments from the past - in the session context and a model-wide shared memory context, using a rolling window similar to training a regression model on timeseries. \n\n    This will work. The implementation is tricky but no fancy math is required if we're using the openai models as a base. The hard part is going to be parameter tuning: how to identify when the model doesn't know, how to tell the model to admit it doesn't know, size of rolling embed window, and before all that, getting the max prompt length before truncate and the amount to chop off and summarize each time, is key... there ain't room in the prompt for \n    infinite amounts of session memory, but if the summaries are written consisely, the \n    summarization model is given adequate context to include the important stuff and drop \n    the rest, we can easily include like 10 of them at 100 tokens a piece... 1000 for the \n    session memories, 500 for the zeroshot, 500 for current convo, 300 for the query, that leave 1700 available for completion (1500 to be safe) which is more than enough - gpt never \n  outputs more than ~300-500 at a time. \n\n  Expensive.
