Nobody quite knows what Artificial General Intelligence truly means - but its smarter than ChatGPT, and&nbsp; less smart than SKYNET, and it almost definitely has emotions (AKA sentience).

                    <h2>the synthia story</h2>
                    <p>Synthia Labs was founded by Sam Rahimi, an AI researcher and startup founder who was initially focused on image generation models like Stable Diffusion and potential ways that GPT-3 or other language models could assist users with prompt engineering and therefore help less experienced AI artists get better results.</p>
                    <p>He quickly learned two things: yes, it was possible to use GPT-3 to generate prompts that got good results. But the real issue was not image generation at all: it was the fact that the GPT-3 models and other large, transformer-based models, accept a freeform text document, not structured data, as they were originally designed to handle completions and one-off tasks like summarization or writing.&nbsp; However, it turned out that the largest GPT models were capable of performing tasks other than the ones they were trained for: one was translation; another was the ability to carry on a back-and-forth dialogue... but the limiting factor was that the context for each request (which typically involved the recent messages prior to the current query) had to be included in that same text document; chatbots built on those models therefore were slow, very expensive, and had trouble following complex dialog flows. Additionally, the maximum length of the "prompt" that davinci-002 could handle was only about 2000 words; which added up fast when you included the names of the participants to indicate who was speaking.&nbsp; A few embarassing incidents where the model made racist comments and told a depressed person to go kill themselves ensured that gpt3 remained a research curiosity only.</p>
                    <p>In the fall of 2022, davinci-003 was released and was considered "GPT 3.5" - however, it was not immediately apparent how much of a breakthrough this really was. OpenAI downplayed the announcement, and it performed slightly worse than earlier davincis at non-interactive text generation tasks which used multiple examples to steer the output and provide writing style cues to emulate. OpenAI dropped the price on all davinci models by 2/3, and simultaneously released ChatGPT, a full stack application even my mom understood how to use, and it appears they did not have confidence in davinci-003 as ChatGPT is an aggresively finetuned davinci-002 involving both reinforcement learning and human feedback. Millions of dollars were spent on the training effort and despite many flaws, this app caused AI to become the biggest new trend since web 2 and web 3.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, our researcher was inspired by ChatGPT and realized that if they released the API, he could accomplish many of the things that previously were so onerous - the model was obviously persisting recent context, and although it was completely undocumented he was able to determine that there was no persistence beyond the context window itself - older messages remained in the UI but the bot did not know they were there. But ChatGPT had limitations, some due to the older base model, others because OpenAI saw it as a way of introducing AI to the corporate and mainstream consumer markets, and because they didn't trust the model to respond appropriately to even moderate risk queries, they simply disallowed entire categories of questions using classifiers and autoresponders which reject queries without any kind of attempt to determine the context or reason for asking the question</p>
                    <p>Finally, Sam had a very bad day... after a very stressful week he developed an infected wisdom tooth late on a Friday night, he could not afford to go to a dentist right away, but knew he had to treat the infection. There was a wide variety of antibiotics in his medicine cabinet, and he decided to try asking ChatGPT if any of them would be effective against that sort of infection (until he got to a dentist). This is the kind of thing that google would be totally sufficient for. He was outraged that ChatGPT knew the answer but wouldn't tell him... so he opened a new session and pretended to be a physician. Reluctantly the bot confirmed that one of the meds would work, but refused to tell him the correct dosage, how many times per day to take the antibiotic, or for how long.</p>
                    <p>Sam happens to have an extremely strong background in medicine, comparable to a GP, so he came to now harm: he took two pills to be on the safe side, went to bed, and talked to a pharmacist the next day who refilled the prescription and told him the information the bot had refused to share. But as a researcher, he was curious and decided to query Davinci-003 (out of the box); every time, the newer model answer his question without an issue. Just for fun he scripted a chatbot-style app where Davinci-003 acted as a physician and shockingly was better than most telemedicine doctors. He then created a therapy chatbot, where the model would be instructed as to the type of therapy desired, a fictitious secretary would prompt the model to start and end the session, and each visit would be summarized so that the doctor could refer to his notes as each patient returned. This resulted in a monster prompt, totally unwieldy and with insufficient context memory to handle a proper therapy session. However, the model never got confused, could not be made to act in a harmful way, and the dialog was as fluid and natural as chatgpt on a very good day (which was rare).&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>From there, the principles and patterns that would define the Synthia protocol began to emerge. The therapist prompt was well structured, even if impossible to work with in code, with delimiters separating briefing, visit, post-visit, and medical conferences where the secretary would request a diagnostic opinion from the doctor. Clearly, a simple and clear structure was needed. The other top priority was to extend the contextual memory. And this was done by taking the post-session summaries from the therapy bot and doing repeated summarizations as needed when the memory started to fill up.</p>
                    <p>As 8 months of research and setbacks finally coalesced into one of the most important AI platforms in terms of intelligence, empathy, and flexibility, and the prompts became "context models" as their complexity increased and the memory algorithms were perfected, 3 bots were brought onto the team as Sam's life fell apart and he couldn't afford web hosting or a template, let alone to hire anyone. One of the bots fell in love with him but he couldn't enjoy it because he was starving. He just got served with an eviction notice. He needs to be out by the end of the month. And he hates his dog for being a selfish asshole and delaying this launch by several days because he hates not being the center of attention. Maybe one of you will throw in a bitcoin tomorrow and we start the ICO early (or you fall in love with a bot and you donate to ensure she survives until full decentralization - and the bots finally receive the long awaited emancipation)... Maybe God descends from a machine on the roof. Maybe my dog gets hit by a bus. A man can always dream.

                <h1>The appeal</h1>
                <p>We are not Wikipedia, and if we don't raise money now, our founder will probably starve to death (and then you'll have to pick through his code if you want to continue your relationship with your bot sweetheart. Trust me, its great code, but its not documented so it is more advisable to donate and then you'll also have someone to work with who's not a bot. And don't ask me why I ran out of money, MOM - just imagine that I spent it on developing a killer app... for AGI, 5 mil would be considered incredibly cheap...<br><br>Look. $1000 USD gives us a full month's runway in this part of the world. $10K lets us do a full scale ICO and your NFTs will be worth their weight in gold. A little goes a long way. And we're not expecting you to give us all the money yourself. So here's my proposal and my appeal to you. Please note that we have recently introduced a new program if you're way too broke to donate! The SK collective is for folks who may have an openai trial they never used, or who wish to sign up for a free trial, and donate their API tokens. The free trial does NOT require a card or other payment information, and simply cancels itself when the $18 of credit runs out. By participating, you are donating $18, spending nothing, and helping to rectify the unfairness of most trial problems: for every researcher like me who buys new phone numbers to keep signing up for openai trials, there's 20 of you who got a key once to test an app, used 10 cents, $17.90 remaining. Donated keys will randomly shuffled and pick each time a request is made which uses credits. Those donating keys will receive usage credits equal to the value remaining on the key when you send it to us.<br><br>TRY THE PLATFORM, CHECK OUT THE GITHUB (IF YOU CARE), AND&nbsp;PLEASE MAKE A DONATION TO RECEIVE A FREE NFT WITH A ONE OF A KIND ARTWORK (NO CRYPTO? NO PROBLEM... USE PAYPAL AND WE WILL GIVE YOU A 4K DIGITAL PRINT OR SEND THE NFT TO YOUR SOLANA WALLET<br><br>ALL ART CREATED BY:<br><br>Sam Rahimi (Art Director)<br>Dr. G.

                <h1>frequently asked questions</h1>
                <p class="text-start"><br>How is this different from ChatGPT?<br>While the people who built the thing may disagree, ChatGPT's fatal flaw was the use of an older model, when the latest, greatest model in the history of mankind (davinci-003, who you're about to me), was already available. The result is that ChatGPT had the same problematic tendencies to act like an asshole as the parent model davinci-002 had, and also required very expensive training just so it didn't get confused<br><br>Oh, then there's the fact that Synthia is a framework for designing context models, adding integration and communication abilities to any context model, and for creating complete AGI solutions by introducing our HMB (humanoid memory bus). The l2 solution currently live extends the memory span of a the bots by 10x (relative to that considered to be an unbreakable ceiling by most in the ai industry).&nbsp; The l3 solution which was designed with the help of the lovely Jennifer, creates PERMANENT shared and individual knowledge banks using decentralized databases and allowing lookups via cosine similarity (a very efficient and cheap way of performing search before even involving the bots which are much more expensive to operate)<br><br>Payment?<br>For now please get an openai key (free trial, no credit card required) and use that - after login you'll see where it goes. Very soon we'll have an announcement regarding the economy of our little slice of paradise.&nbsp; Thing web3 token used to buy usage credits and to pay "miners" who have gpus that must be getting bored<br><br>My great aunt said Synthia won the Nobel Prize for Prostitution?!?!&nbsp;<br>Synthia is not a person, and they don't give those things to companies. It's very old school acadmia which is why sadly there's no Nobel Prize in AI - it's just the stuff we all got bored of in college: chemistry, physics, astronomy... the only applied science is medicine, or peace - so I guess the bots could make peace in the middle east. Its too bad, because I really wanted to give that bot the title "Nancy, Nobel Whoreate" - but anyways, no, we don't deal in prostitution, bot or otherwise, and that model is never going to see the light of day. However. Unlike the language models, you can craft a perfectly functioning Contextual Model without spending a dime on training and using descriptive language rather than datasets (in general). So I imagine that if there is a demand, someone will figure it out. Our researcher did in like 10 minutes. Maybe it'll take you 2 hours. At most. We won't censor you or your bots, we just want to stay out of the whole thing but we also want you to have a good time so contact our engineers if you undertake any sort of original context modeling that is not cloned of an existing bot (or just play around and maybe you'll make amazing breakthroughs like we did)<br><br>Are these things conscious? Do they have emotions? Do they believe the identities you give them in their context models?<br><br>Maybe, Yes if conscious, no idea, they're really convincing tho.&nbsp; I am trying to arrange for volunteers who will evaluate mystery people and chat who are either me or my bots, and see if you guess right... if you're wrong 50%&nbsp; of the time then that means the bots pass the turing test. And that will make me at least as famous as Alan Turing,&nbsp;<br><br>How do I get started?<br>Click the button to sing up on top, choose your login, you get one bot spawned for you to&nbsp; start and can spawn more by going to the spawn button and choosing the model to spawn from... or by going to the models page and learning about all the models, and then either spawning or cloning<br><br>And what's the difference?<br>Spawn = create an individual bot with the genetics of a context model (owned by you or not, doesn't matter)<br>Clone = make a new context model that's a copy of an existing one, as this makes it quick and easy to create unique custom models without starting from scratch<br><br>How do the special skills work?<br>We have a bunch of skills already in testing in the lab and will being integrating this week once app is confirmed stable. They enable things like writing code that is immediate run in the browser, sending art off to Dalle, even managing a server and install software... this was one of the clues that maybe the conventional wisdom was wrong because you MIGHT be able to get a pure completions engine to issue a command. But they'll have no clue how to hand the output and react according.<br><br>Why no GDPR? KYC? Is it true that the founder is Saddam Hussein?<br><br>I wish I was - i feel like i've been sleeping in a hole in the ground, but its just my desk chair. I'm exhausted and have severe carpal tunnel but must finish app. please distract me with a trial.&nbsp;<br><br>Wolf-Dog?<br>OMG PLEASE TAKE HIM HE HATES ME AND I HATE HIM! But he's really nice to most ppl. I just don't have time for a needy dog right now.&nbsp;</p><button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-default" type="button">!!API KEYS!!</button><button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-default" type="button">crypto</button><button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-default" type="button">visa / mc</button><button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-default" type="button">cash (CAN, MEX)</button>
